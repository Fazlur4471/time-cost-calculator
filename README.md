# Time Cost Calculator

Time Cost Calculator is a small, reflective web app that helps people understand the **long-term time impact of everyday habits**.

Instead of tracking productivity or pushing optimization, it focuses on **awareness** — showing how small daily actions quietly add up over weeks, months, and years.

> No judgment. Just clarity.

## ✨ What It Does

- Takes a daily activity (e.g. *scrolling Instagram*)
- Calculates how much **time it costs weekly, monthly, and yearly**
- Converts that time into:
  - Full days
  - Workdays
- Gently shows **what that same time could also be spent on**, using realistic human activities

The goal is not to tell users what to do — only to give perspective.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

People often underestimate time because:
- Daily durations feel small
- Long-term accumulation is hard to visualize

This tool bridges that gap by translating abstract hours into **human-scale equivalents** that feel intuitive and relatable.
